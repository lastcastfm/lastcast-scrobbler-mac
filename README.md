# Lastcast for Mac

Lastcast for Mac is the native scrobbler app for macOS. It currently supports:

- Apple Podcasts
- Overcast (In Development)

It works by reading the local database of Apple Podcasts that’s synced via iCloud from all your devices. It submits your listening data to [lastcast.fm](https://lastcast.fm) where you can track your listening habits and get personal statistics.

## Download

## Development

This project is my first Swift / SwiftUI project and this probably shows. Contributions, criticism and hints are very appreciated. The current status is that it “works for me” and isn’t tested in a lot of conditions.
